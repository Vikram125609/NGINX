Nginx is a web server.
All the request will be served by the Nginx
Nginx can be used as gateway, reverse proxy, caching, rate limiting, load balancing, host static sites, host multiple sites, tls termination.

Nginx is very extandable. we can use our own custom logic and custom functionality using the Lua language script
even you can write javascript in the nginx by using njs

there is a special folder All the configuration in the linux machine and the external application is getting stored in the cd /etc/

all the files in the cd /etc/nginx will be different as per the operating system 

in the directory file nginx.conf is very important file and it is the entry point of nginx. it start from this file only when nginx start


include /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;
⬆️ In the above line the "include" is called as directive in nginx this will embed the file as the path given in front of include 

in the directory /etc/nginx/sites-enabled file default
"listen" is also an directive 
server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server;
    root /var/www/html;
    index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;
    server_name _;
    location / {
            # First attempt to serve request as file, then
            # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}

listen 80 default_server => This statement indicate that the all the connection on port 80 will be managed by this server block
listen 80 default_server => This statement is for IPv4
listen [::]:80 default_server => This statement is for IPv6
root inside the server block is also an directive 
server_name is also an directive 
there is also an location block in the server block

now what is happening when the request is comming on port 80 
it says go to the location which is written in front of the root directive 
and in that location the index or the main file can be index.html index.htm index.nginx-debain.html
so initally when you hit the request on port 80 nginx will serve the page index.nginx-debain.html which is present in the /var/www/html 

default http port is 80 
and default port for https : 443

✅ Understanding Configurations ✅
The configuration of nginx is in a special structure that is tree.
All block is also called as context
Each context has a specific setting and we can override in the
