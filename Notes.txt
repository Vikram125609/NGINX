Nginx is a web server.
All the request will be served by the Nginx
Nginx can be used as gateway, reverse proxy, caching, rate limiting, load balancing, host static sites, host multiple sites, tls termination.

Nginx is very extandable. we can use our own custom logic and custom functionality using the Lua language script
even you can write javascript in the nginx by using njs

there is a special folder All the configuration in the linux machine and the external application is getting stored in the cd /etc/

all the files in the cd /etc/nginx will be different as per the operating system 

in the directory file nginx.conf is very important file and it is the entry point of nginx. it start from this file only when nginx start


include /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;
⬆️ In the above line the "include" is called as directive in nginx this will embed the file as the path given in front of include 

in the directory /etc/nginx/sites-enabled file default
"listen" is also an directive 
server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server;
    root /var/www/html;
    index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;
    server_name _;
    location / {
            # First attempt to serve request as file, then
            # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}

listen 80 default_server => This statement indicate that the all the connection on port 80 will be managed by this server block
listen 80 default_server => This statement is for IPv4
listen [::]:80 default_server => This statement is for IPv6
root inside the server block is also an directive 
server_name is also an directive 
there is also an location block in the server block

now what is happening when the request is comming on port 80 
it says go to the location which is written in front of the root directive 
and in that location the index or the main file can be index.html index.htm index.nginx-debain.html
so initally when you hit the request on port 80 nginx will serve the page index.nginx-debain.html which is present in the /var/www/html 

default http port is 80 
and default port for https : 443

✅ Understanding Configurations ✅
The configuration of nginx is in a special structure that is tree.
All block is also called as context
Each context has a specific setting and we can override in the child block
the most top level block is called as main context

when the nginx run it has one master process and some worker processes which is used for handling the connection
now what will be number of worker process that configuration will be done in the main context 

main (i) => no. of worker process (ii) user name (iii) pid (iV) log location 

event block in main => (i) no. of connections per worker process 🔥 Can be change for optimization on the production side as per the server capacity and many more such setting 
stream block in main => (i) the comming request can by tcp or udp. The setting related to the network layer and transport layer will be done in this context 
http block in main (very important and most used) => (i) how to process the request (ii) There can be multiple server blocks

Two main block in the http context
server block in http => (i) Creating virtual server in it or Creating virtual host. When we host multiple site of different domain on our server so all the setting is done in the server block
upstream block in http => (i) Upstream block is utilized when we use reverse-proxy. We are sending request to the nginx but in the backgroung the nginx send requests to the server this is called reverse proxy (ii) Can also be used for load balancing

location block in server => (i) routing of the url  

It is highly recommneded by the Nginx team that if you write any configuration file then write it in the cd /etc/nginx/conf.d and it is included in the main block

After changing in the file you can restart the nginx or you can reload and restarting the nginx is not a best practice there will a downtime

you should test first before reload
